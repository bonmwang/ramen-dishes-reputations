# ramen-dishes-reputations
In this project, you'll create a web application for rating ramen dishes entirely from scratch. You'll practice handling user events, manipulating the DOM, structuring JavaScript code effectively, and using Git basics. No server communication or external servers are required; instead, you'll use static data provided within your project.
